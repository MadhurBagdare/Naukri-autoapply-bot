"""Share interest in Naukri "Early access" roles.

Early access roles are not job postings.  They are saved recruiter searches:
Naukri stores the Boolean query a recruiter ran against its resume database and
shows it to candidates the query matched.  The card's button says "Share
interest", not "Apply" - pressing it flags the profile against that saved query
so the profile ranks higher when the recruiter runs it again.

Two consequences shape this module:

* No application is created, so **none of the 50/day apply quota is spent**.
  This runs beside the apply pipeline and can never cannibalise it.
* The cards carry no job id, no data attribute and no link - the title is an
  ``<a>`` without an href.  Roles are therefore keyed by a hash of their
  visible text so a second run does not re-share the same one.

The page is a client-side route: navigating straight to
``/mnjuser/recommended-earjobs`` redirects to the homepage.  It only resolves
when the homepage "View all" link is clicked, which is what ``open_page`` does.
